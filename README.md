Edge Detection for Triple Phase Contactline imaged with Inverted Microscopy
Imaging Contact Line Interaction Using Inverted Microscopy with High Magnification can generate many optical abbertations, considering that we use High Speed Microscopy to capture Fast Contact Line dynamics, We need to perform a couple of filtering transformations in order to obtain the edges.
